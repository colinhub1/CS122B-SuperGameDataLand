Project Data & Web Apps: Designed and developed video game database with HTML interface using Java, MySQL, HTML, JavaScript, and AWS cloud Ubuntu.
Interface allowed users to traverse through the webpage and display games and their purchase history.

Given the amount of setup that was required when working, the code can not be run unfortunately.
The java,python,js,html,and sql files are all present to show the work that was done.
